## Cross-modal-retrieval
Our approach is focus on Activity Image-to-Video Retrieval (AIVR) task. 
The compared methods are state-of-the-art single modality hashing methods, multiple modalities
hashing methods and cross-modal retrieval methods.

#### Single modality hashing methods
Some hashing baselines for image retrieval can be found in <https://github.com/willard-yuan/hashing-baseline-for-image-retrieval>.
#### Multiple modalities hashing methods
More details refer to <https://github.com/czxxjtu/Hash-Learning.github.io>.
Some details about hashing methods are in hashing-baseline-for-image-retrieval-master folder.
#### Cross-modal retrieval methods
The compared cross-modal retrieval methods are according to the paper:
