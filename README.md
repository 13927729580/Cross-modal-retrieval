# Cross-modal-retrieval
Our approach is focus on Activity Image-to-Video Retrieval (AIVR) task. 
The compared methods are state-of-the-art single modality hashing methods, multiple modalities
hashing methods and cross-modal retrieval methods.

### Single modality hashing methods
Some hashing baselines for image retrieval can be found in <https://github.com/willard-yuan/hashing-baseline-for-image-retrieval>.
